I expect this course to be useful as GitHub is a very important tool in computer science. I won't be limited by the tedious tasks of creating google drives anymore and it will be an upgrade to the quality of life of my coding with other people. I also expect to learn how to do a simple application on my phone along with all it's features. My senior said this course was relatively easy and I trust his opinion. That's all.
